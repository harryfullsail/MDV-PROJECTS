<p>My theme is where I work and how I help the  blind and physical handicap at my job.  
Providing books for those who cannot see print.  The type of books we provide are digital books. So they can enjoy books just as a sighted person would.  This is an amazing service for many people.</p>
<p> This is a free service that the library of Congress offers to the blind and physically handicapped. Providing books through the Mail on a digital cartridge.  You can also downloading from our website to a digital cartridge.</p>
